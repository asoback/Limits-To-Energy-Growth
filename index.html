		<p>The growth of renewables and nuclear energy remains the same,

		<p>Here is where we start to see a real problem: The demand line, in pink.
			The further it gets from the total supply, likely the more it energy of any

	<!-- How could population affect this -->

		<h3>Population</h3>
		<p>Some people think the population will just level out at 10 Billion in just a few short years.</p>
		<p>Others think maybe it'll get to 11, or 12 Billion.</p>
		<p>Some people think we'll overshoot and our population will have to fall back down to something more sustainable.</p>
		<p>Still some think our Earthly population could skyrocket much higher.</p>

		<p>Once we reach the Earth's carrying capacity and our population stabalizes
