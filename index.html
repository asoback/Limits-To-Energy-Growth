			<h1>One More Reason Why We Need A Green New Deal</h1>

			<p>Here's how much oil the US Government <sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup>
				says that the whole world has used since the 80s.
				The data is indexed, so that 100 is the total amount of energy consumed by all of
				humanity in the year 1980. 200 would be twice that amount of energy, like we see
				around 2014. Persumable, if the amount of energy consumed doubles every 34 years,
				then it would have been gotten a 50 in 1946, and would reach 400 by 2050.

			<p>When scientists<sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup>, the government<sup><a href="">[2]</a></sup>,
				or others say things like "at current rates of use, we have about 52 years of oil left"
				Or how we at current rates of use, coal would last another 130 year, and over 50 for
				natural gas, this is what that looks like as a graph. Of course, the supply of
				renewables is assumed to grow. This isn't exactly a likely scenario.</p>

		<!--  Here's what it might look like with prediction -->
		<div>
			<p>We can make a few assumptions about the future, and improve this model.
			<ul>
				<li>Renewables continue to grow</li>
				<li>Demand continues to grow (The pink line)</li>
				<li>Non-renewables will grow for some time, peak, then decline</li>
			</ul>	
				Here there is a problem. Significantly more demand than supply. What will this mean 
				for the cost of energy, the availability of energy around the globe, infrastructure 
				where we live?

				Does this have to be a problem? Yes. The reason is that as coal, natural gas, and
				oil run out, in order for nuclear and renewables to keep up with growing demand, 
				they would have to not only keep up with their own growth, they'd have to make up
				for the missing fossil fuel growth, and replace the fossil fuel consumption as it 
				drops. The growth required of renewables and nuclear would be absolutely massive.
				Larger than any project ever completed by humanity type massive. In fact, the growth
				required is likely <a href="https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/10/the-energy-trap/">
				larger than is even possible</a>.

		<!-- Peak demand per person -->
		<div>
			<p>Once we reach the Earth's carrying capacity and our population stabalizes
				our per capita energy may continue to grow, until perhaps that balances
				out as well.
			</p>
			<div>
				<canvas class="chart" id="PeakDemandChart"></canvas>
			</div>
			<p>Right now the average person uses around 90 Million BTUs per year</p>
			<p>The average American, in contrast, uses like 21 times that per year<sup>[citation needed]</sup>	</p>
			<p>Compare standard of living to the average person today. The average person today gets  a 1.
				if we bring every person up to the US standard of living, that is 21. If we double everyones energy use, globally
				that is 42, etc.
			</p>
			<p>Where this starts is a bad scenario. The rich get go richer, the poor get no poorer, energy wise.
				If there is a change, the rich and the poor either gravitate towards some middle ground, 
				or perhaps inequality becomes even greater.
			</p>
			<p>See what happens when you double that number. See what it looks like if everyone moves towards the American
				standard of living (21).

			<h3>Undiscovered Resources</h3>

			<p>The amount of remaining resources so far that we've been discussing
				are what oil companies are 90% confident we will be able to find and 
				retrieve. Of course, there may be more that we are able to dig up under
				the oceans, and climate change melting the polar regions of the planet 
				will pave the way for even more fossil fuel discoveries. 
			</p>
			<p> It's also worth considering that we won't use every last drop 
				as the climate crisis develops and as our civilization decides to
				transition to a sustainable future.

		<!-- Conclusion -->
		<div>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Exponential energy growth forever without breaks is flat out impossible.
				Exponential population growth forever without breaks is flat out impossible.
				Obviously, exponential improvements in technological efficiency forever is also impossible,
				as a transister can only get so small, a solar panel can only get so efficient, etc.
				Understanding both of those should make it easy to see that services per person,
				productivity per person, and other factors that influence economic growth are
				also subject to very real, fast approaching limits.
			</p>
			<p>As a global civilization, we will either hit plateaus, or collapses.
				A collapse is obviously bad, but a plateau does not have to be. It can be intentional.
				We can make it work for us by changing our economic system to one build around
				the idea of "steady state".
